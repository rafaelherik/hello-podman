Playing with Podman

## Introduction


### Podman vs Docker

Podman and Docker share many features in common but have some fundamental differences. These don't make one better than the other but might be decisive to select the most appropriate for a specific project.

The main point is the archtecture, Docker uses a daemon, it's an ongoing program running in background that runs with root privileges (There is a way to install a rootless docker also but it's not the default). In the other way, podman has no daemon allowing non-root privileges for cotainers that is considered safer.

As Podman has no daemon, it needs another tool to manage services and supporting running containers in the background. Systemd is the answer, it creates control unints for existing containers or generate new ones.\

But, what is systemd? [Here we go](https://documentation.suse.com/smart/systems-management/html/systemd-basics/index.html)
